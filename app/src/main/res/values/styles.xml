        I made the accent color the same color as the primary, because the only place you see the
        accent color is in the Article Detail activity, which takes its palette from the photo
        rather than the app theme, so I thought it was good to have the FAB and progress bar
        reinforce the app primary color rather than be some other color that had no relation to
        anything other than contrasting with colors that aren't even onscreen.
